Systems Anaylsis and Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. 

Who was the client? 
Liam is the owner of the system for DrivePass

What type of system did they want you to design? 
Liam wanted a web-based system to allow mulitple users to take
practice tests, schedule on-the-road training, and take online courses. 

What did you do particularly well?  
I did well at Identifying sysetem requirements, both functional and non-functional. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick?
I would revise the class diagram 

How would you improve it?
I would more carefully connect the classes and add one more class to account for the practices tests 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design?
The user's needs were interpreted into several diagrams including: a use case diagram, activiy diagrams, and a class diagram. the needs 
were also interpreted into requirements that the system will need in order to function. 

Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's needs are most important because they will be using the system and having
what the user wants lets them accept and learn to use the system more easily 

How do you approach designing software? 

What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
